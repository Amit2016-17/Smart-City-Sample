The following services are running as part of the maintainence tasks:
- **Indexing**: If any live analytics exist, they will be auto-indexed to match to the recorded data so users can perform 'where' queries on the recording data. See also [where query](../doc/search.md).   
- **Uploading**: Upload selected recording data, whose analytics data meet defined criteria, to cloud for archival or further processing/analysis. Transcoding to H.265 is done to save network bandwidth.       
- **Health Check**: Check health of the running system. Alert any inbalance in terms of analytics instances and #sensors etc.
